1. The data has been filtered on ontdoener location instead of herkomst, while herkomst is where the waste has been disposed. Does that mean we miss data from the companies that are not registered in AMA but produce waste in AMA?
2. Does household waste ever end up in LMA data as e.g. secondary waste?
3. Why do the other roles do in the waste chain: Ontdoener → Herkomst → Afzender → Inzamelaar → Bemiddelaar → Handelaar → Ontvanger → Verwerker ?
4. How can we treat route inzamelling and inzamelaars regeling?
5. What should we do with missing data, e.g. actors without addresses or names? Skip or fill?
- Decided on 17 Sep that we would skip and log how many entries have been skipped for which reason - then decide based on statistics
6. How do we integrate EVOA data?
7. How do we make sure that LMA data always comes in the same structure (e.g. same column names, same sheet names, etc.) (as it doesn't...) ?
8. What can we do with afgiftemeldingen?
